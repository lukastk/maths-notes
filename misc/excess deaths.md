Let $D_{ij}$ be the number of deaths during week $i$ of year $j$, and let $N_{ij}$ be the population during the same time. The weekly death rate at that time is then $d_{ij} = \frac{D_{ij}}{N_{ij}}$.

The average weekly death rate during week $i$ of any given year is

$$
\bar{d}_i = \frac{1}{\sum_j 1} \sum_j d_{ij}
$$

and the standard deviation is

$$
