Let $D_{ij}$ be the number of deaths during week $i$ of year $j = 1, \dots, n$, and let $N_{ij}$ be the population during the same time. The weekly death rate at that time is then $d_{ij} = \frac{D_{ij}}{N_{ij}}$.

The average weekly death rate during week $i$ of any given year is

$$
\bar{d}_i = \frac{1}{n} \sum_j d_{ij}
$$

and the standard deviation is

$$
\text{STD}[d_i] = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n (d_j - \bar{d}_j)^2 }
$$

Herd immunity is reached when a large enough proportion of the population is immune (either recovered or vaccinated), where the immunized serve as a buffer, lowering the probability of secondary infections.
