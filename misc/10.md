Let $R_0$ and $R_*$ be the radii of the planet and the sun respectively, and $D$ the distance between them.

We need to find the total luminosity landing on the planet. This can be approximated as

$$
P_\text{in} = L_* \frac{ \pi R_0^2}{4 \pi D^2}
$$

where the ratio $\frac{ \pi R_0^2}{4 \pi D^2}$ is an approximation of the proportion of the luminosity that reaches the planet.

Since the planet is a black body, we can use Stefan's law to compute it's luminosity as well $P_\text{out}$. The energy flowing out of the planet must be equal to the energy flowing out in equilibrium, so we have

$$
P_\text{in} = P_\text{out}
$$

from which we find that $T_0 \approx 17^o$.
