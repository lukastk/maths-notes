### Simple (and rough) method to estimate density-dependence of local contact matrices

Let $C_{ij}$ be the national contact matrix for the UK. We assume that at location $\ell$, the local contact matrix $C^\ell_{ij}$ scales as

$$
C^\ell_{ij} = \frac{\rho^\ell}{\bar{\rho}} C_{ij}
$$

where $\rho^\ell = N^\ell / A^\ell$ is the local population density and $\rho = N / A$ is the national population density.

Recall that $C_{ij}$ is the *average* number of people from age class $j$ that people from $i$ meet during a day
