Herd immunity is reached when a large enough proportion of the population is immune (either recovered or vaccinated), where the immunized serve as a buffer, lowering the probability of secondary infections.

The herd immunity criterion is

$$
h = \frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0}
$$

where $R_0$ is the basic reproductive ratio, which is the number of secondary infections produced by a typical case of an infection in a population where everyone is susceptible. Herd immunity is reached when $h \times N$  number of people have been infected and recovered from the virus, where $N$ is the population of the country.

As the basic reproductive ratio is both a function of the inherent infectivity of the pathogen, as well as the social contact structure of the susceptibles, $R_0$ has a lower value during lock-down. This is why there is often talk about "keeping $R_0$ below $1$" in the media.

Estimates for $R_0$ of the COVID-19 virus vary from $1.4$ to $5.7$ [Ref: 1-4], outside of a lock-down. Using the conservative estimate of $R_0 = 1.4$, we can estimate the herd immunity criterion to be $h \sim 28.7\%$. This would mean approximately $19$ million of the UK's $66.65$ million inhabitants would have to be infected for herd immunity to be reached. This is a lower-bound.

Current estimates from SAGE suggest that $4\%$ of the population have been infected with the coronavirus as of the 27th of April. Based on the previous calculation, this would leave us with an estimated $16.4$ million additional infections required for herd immunity to be reached, in the absence of lock-down. These would very likely occur on a time-scale before a vaccine could be found.
