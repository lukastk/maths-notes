## Smallpox transmission and control: Spatial dynamics in Great Britain

$R_0$ - average number of secondary infections generated by a typically infectious individual in an otherwise susceptible population.

$\theta$ - the proportion of infections that occur before the onset of symptoms is defined to be $\theta$.

"Interventions that rely on the
recognition of symptoms to reduce transmission, such as case
isolation and contact tracing, are more likely to be successful when $\theta$ is small than when it is large."

$R_0^*$ - the expected number of secondary infectiosn generated by a randomly chosen infectious individual in an otherwise susceptible population.

$a$ -  the household attack rate, which we
defined to be the proportion of susceptible household members
infected by a single infectious individual
