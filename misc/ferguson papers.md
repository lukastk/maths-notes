## Smallpox transmission and control: Spatial dynamics in Great Britain

$R_0$ - average number of secondary infections generated by a typically infectious individual in an otherwise susceptible population.

$\theta$ - the proportion of infections that occur before the onset of symptoms is defined to be $\theta$.

"Interventions that rely on the
recognition of symptoms to reduce transmission, such as case
isolation and contact tracing, are more likely to be successful when $\theta$ is small than when it is large."

$R_0^*$ - the expected number of secondary infectiosn generated by a randomly chosen infectious individual in an otherwise susceptible population.

$a$ -  the household attack rate, which we
defined to be the proportion of susceptible household members
infected by a single infectious individual

#### Model

Agent-based model of disease progression and transmission in a population of $N$ individuals. $k_i$ is the disease state of the $i$th individual, where $i$ ranges from 1 to $N$. (see fig 1)

The structure of the model allowed for transmission in three settings: household, peer-group network, and community. During any period of time $\Delta t$ the probability that individual $i$ in disease state $k_i$ infected individual $j$ in disease state $k_j = 0$ was defined as follows:

$$
P_\text{inf}(i,k_i,j) = I_{HH}(i,j) (1 - e^{-\beta h_k h_{h/w} \Delta t} ) + I_{PGN}(i,j) (1 - e^{-\beta h_k \Delta t}) + b(i, j, \Delta t) h_k \kappa_{NT} (| \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|) \quad (1)
$$

The first two terms of (1) correspond to household and peer-group network transmission respectively. 

- $I_{HH}$ is an indicator function, equal to 1 only if $i$ and $j$ share a household, and is equal to 0 otherwise.
- $I_{PGN}(i,j)$ is the indicator function for $i$ and $j$ sharing a peer-group network link.
- $\beta$
