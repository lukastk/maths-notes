The problem has three components: sellers (SHFs), buyers and economic stress imposed by Soko.

In the absence of logistical costs, the market interaction between buyers and sellers becomes a very simple miscroeconomic supply and demand problem. The per-unit cost of production of the farmers would be some decreasing function of quantity, that we can probably find from literature. We use this curve to then to calculate the price of the product based on supply and demand (which we would also have to find from the literature).

Soko changes the picture by introducing some extra costs:

- Logistical costs
- Service charge for buyers
