The problem has three components: sellers (SHFs), buyers and economic stress imposed by Soko.

In the absence of logistical costs, the market interaction between buyers and sellers becomes a very simple miscroeconomic supply and demand problem. The per-unit cost of production of the farmers would be some decreasing function of quantity, that we can probably find from literature. We use this curve to then to calculate the price of the product based on supply and demand (which we would also have to find from the literature).

Soko changes the picture by introducing some extra costs:

- Logistical costs
- Service charge for buyers

(The latter is a bit problematic for us, as microeconomically it is possible that the service charge will cut out of the profits of the farmers. But this is something that this exercise can actually measure to some extent.)

The logistical costs will add an interesting component to the problem. The cost of logistics is a function of the Euclidean distance between the buyer and the seller.\* Which means that the cost 

Agent-based

Within the idealisations of microeconomics, this exercise is quite doable. I don't think the results will be quantitatively predictive of reality, but I do think it will paint us a qualitative picture.

Why this exercise could be useful:

- The effect of logistical costs. Should we make the buyer or the farmer pay for it?
- The effect of the service charge. Does it drive down prices 

<small> \* Does it matter whether the buyer or the seller has to pay for the logistical costs? My intuition says that the only effect is that prices will just off-load the effect, regardless of whether we make the buyer/seller pay for it. Actually, it probably does make a difference, as each farmer and buyer is spread geographically. Making the farmer/buyer pay for logistical costs would probably have an effect due to this. </small>
