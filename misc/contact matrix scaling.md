We have a contact matrix $C_{ij}$, satisfying

$$
N_i C_{ij} = N_j C_{ji}
$$

 from which we want to construct local contact matrices $C^\mu_{ij}$, which in turn must satisfy

$$
N_i^\mu C^\mu_{ij} = N_j^\mu C^\mu_{ji},
$$

where $N^i_{\mu}$ is the population of age-group $i$ at location $\mu$. Furthermore, $C_{ij}$ and $C^\mu_{ij}$ must satisfy the consistency relation

$$
