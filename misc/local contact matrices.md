# Local contact matrices

Here we consider a method by which to construct local contact matrices from national contact matrices. Let $C_{ij}$ be the contact matrix for the UK, and $C_{ij}^\ell$ the contact matrix for place $\ell$ in the UK.

For both contact matrices the consistency relation

$$
\begin{aligned}
N_{i} C_{ij} & = N_j C_{ji} \\
N_i^\ell C^\ell_{ij} & = N_j^\ell C_{ij}^\ell
\end{aligned} \quad (1)
$$

must be satisfied.

There are two things we want to consider in the construction of $C_{ij}^\ell$:

1. Eq. 1 must hold for all $\ell$.
2. Contact should scale with population density.

### 1. Satisfying the local consistency relations

We let

$$
C^\ell_{ij} = \frac{f_j^\ell}{f_j}
$$
