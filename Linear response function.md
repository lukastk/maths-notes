Let $\phi_i(t)$ be the input of a system (e.g a force), and $\Delta x_i(t)$ the response of the system (e.g a position). In general it is difficult to understand how a system responds to the inputs, but for some systems we can make the assumption that the 



Generally, the value of $x(t)$ will depend not only on the present value of $h(t)$, but also on past values.
