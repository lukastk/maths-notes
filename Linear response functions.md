# Linear response functions

Let $\phi_i(t)$ be the input into a system (e.g a force), and $\Delta \mathcal{O}_i(t)$ the response of the system (e.g a position). In general it is difficult to understand how a system responds to the inputs, but for some systems we can make the assumption that the input results in a small perturbation of the original system. Mathematically, this means that we assume that the response of the system is linear in the perturbing input. We write

$$
\Delta \mathcal{O}_i(t) = \int dt'\ \chi_{ij} (t ; t') \phi_j(t')
$$

Where $\chi_{ij}(t;t')$ is the *response function*.

Generally, the value of $x(t)$ will depend not only on the present value of $h(t)$, but also on past values.
