This is a small note in response to some notes made during Julian's lecture. I had some comments on perhaps why there is sometimes confusion about the role of paths in the FW and OM. I think the confusion partially stems from the fact that the the tube occupies very different positions in both theories.

In Freidlin-Wentzell theory, the instanon (the most-probable path) is in a privilged position. If one computes the instanton between two minima, then the FW large-deviation result predicts that any deviation from the instanton is supressed exponentially. But as we all know, this is all in a very peculiar limit (both infinite times and infinitesimal noise).

It is a matter of debate perhaps whether one should treat the instanton as an observable or not. In general it is not obvious at all that the most-probable path (which is a synonym of instanton in this case) should be something we would expect to observe at all, given entropic effects etc. There's an added difficulty that it takes a great deal of experimental/numerical results to actually generate enough paths to see whether the FW instanton holds true.

On the other hand FW theory does produce some other very measurable results. Escape times and steady states in particular.

Importantly, all these "second-hand" results always come via the computation of the instanton first. Which means that
