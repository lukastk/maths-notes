This is a small note in response to some notes made during Julian's lecture. I had some comments on perhaps why there is sometimes confusion about the role of paths in the FW and OM. I think the confusion partially stems from the fact that the the tube occupies very different positions in both theories.

In Freidlin-Wentzell theory, the instanon (the most-probable path) is in a privilged position. If one computes the instanton between two minima, then the FW large-deviation result predicts that any deviation from the instanton is supressed exponentially. But as we all know, this is all in a very peculiar limit (both infinite times and infinitesimal noise).

It is a matter of debate perhaps whether one should treat the instanton as an observable or not. In general it is not obvious at all that the most-probable path (which is a synonym of instanton in this case) should be something we would expect to observe at all, given entropic effects etc. There's an added difficulty that it takes a great deal of experimental/numerical results to actually generate enough paths to see whether the FW 

On the other hand FW theory does produce some other very measurable 


There are a number of nice second-hand results that can be immediately derived
