This is a small note in response to some notes made during Julian's lecture. I had some comments on perhaps why there is sometimes confusion about the role of paths in the FW and OM. I think the confusion partially stems from the fact that the the tube occupies very different positions in both theories.

In Freidlin-Wentzell theory, the instanon (the most-probable path) is in a privilged position. If one computes the instanton between two minima, then the FW large-deviation result predicts that any deviation from the instanton is supressed exponentially. But as we all know, this is all in a very peculiar limit (both infinite times and infinitesimal noise).

It is a matter of debate perhaps whether one should treat the instanton as an observable or not. In general it is not obvious at all that the most-probable path (which is a synonym of instanton in this case) should be something we would expect to observe at all, given entropic effects etc. There's an added difficulty that it takes a great deal of experimental/numerical results to actually generate enough paths to see whether the FW instanton holds true.

On the other hand FW theory does produce some other very measurable results. Escape times and steady states in particular.

Importantly, all these "second-hand" results always come via the computation of the instanton first. And this further reinforces our view of the importance of the FW instanton, and perhaps its stature as a physical observable.

None of these results hold true in the OM case. There the effects of entropy/diffusion affect the system to the extent that, though most-probable paths exist, they are in no way physically very important. The most probable paths are still extremely improbable, and one would never expect to observe them. The instantons are also in general quite trivial (they tend to simply hang around the basins for infinity, and the actions are usually $-\infty$). Additionally, there are no easy second-hand observable that one can compute from the instantons.

So the OM instanton and the FW instantons are quite different beasts altogether.

I think one thing one could do the gauge the connection between the two, and also to find the relative regimes of applicability of both, is to compare the escape times predicted by both theories.

For FW, it's simple:

$$
\tau_\text{FW} \sim e^{-S^*_\text{FW}}
$$

For OM, I think we could write it as

$$
\tau_\text{OM} = \int_0^\infty dT \int dx(t)
$$
