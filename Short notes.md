## Multiple-scale analysis

Standard perturbation techniques involve expanding the solution of an equation in a power series in some "small parameter". So for the Duffing equation

$$ \frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + y + \epsilon y^3 = 0, \quad y(0) =1, \quad \frac{dy}{dt}(0) = 0 $$

we would expand the solution as

$$ y(t) = Y_0(t) + \epsilon Y_1(t) + O(\epsilon^2). $$

This leads to

$$ y(t) = \cos (t) + \epsilon \left[ \right] $$
