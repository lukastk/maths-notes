-   Cap table: "Who owns what?"

-   On day 0 of the enterprise, it's easy to shuffle the cap table around, as the company isn't valuated very much. Later on, this will be difficult as there are tax implications.

-   Valuation: Very subjective. Once the business start selling shares, we need to decide our valuation.

-   In technical terms: The valuation of a company is the price the market is willing to pay for it. In practice this isn't always easy to figure out, obviously.

-   Share certificate

-   You don't need share certificates for the initial share distribution, but you do need paper certificates for share transfers (buying, selling shares).
